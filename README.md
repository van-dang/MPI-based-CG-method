# MPI-based-CG-method
n this project, we develop two MPI-based solvers to solve the Poisson equation on Cartesian grids: the Jacobi and the conjugate gradient (CG) methods. The finite difference method will be used for space discretization. Thanks to the funtionalities of the MPI virtual topology, the computational domain is decomposed into subdomains and then each subdomain is assigned to a MPI process. The performance analysis will also be taken into account in this project.
